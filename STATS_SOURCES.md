## ❌ STATISTICS THAT NEED CORRECTION

### 1. Brand Recognition in Children
**Current claim:** "300 brand logos recognized by 3-year-olds"
**Reality:** Research shows 3-5 year olds recognized 50-93% of 12-50 brands tested, NOT 300 brands
**Source:** McAlister & Cornwell (2010) study in Brisbane

**Recommended correction:**
Change to: "Research shows children as young as 3 can recognize dozens of brand logos before they can read"
Or use actual stat: "93% brand recognition for fast food logos among preschoolers"

### 2. Loneliness Increase
**Current claim:** "61% of Americans feel lonely - up from 46% in 2019"
**Reality:** 61% in 2019, up from 54% in 2018
**Source:** Cigna Loneliness Index

**Correction needed:**
"61% of Americans report feeling lonely (2019) - up from 54% the year before"

### 3. Advertising & Depression
**Current claim:** "52% higher depression with heavy ad exposure"
**Reality:** The European study found 3% life satisfaction drop from doubling advertising, NOT 52% higher depression
**Source:** Michel et al. (2019) - 1 million Europeans study

**Recommended correction:**
Either remove this specific stat or use: "Doubling advertising exposure results in a 3% drop in life satisfaction"
Or use: "Heavy advertising exposure linked to significantly lower life satisfaction and increased materialism"

### 4. $1.2 Trillion Description
**Current claim:** "That's how much tech companies spent perfecting your addiction"
**Reality:** $1.2T is global advertising REVENUE (total industry size), not R&D spending
**Source:** Statista 2024

**Correction needed:**
Change to: "The global advertising industry - $1.2 trillion spent every year to influence your behavior"

### 5. 77% of Ads Work by Making You Inadequate
**Current claim:** "77% of ads work by making you feel inadequate first"
**Reality:** Could not verify this specific percentage
**Source:** Listed as "Marketing Week 2024" but needs verification

**Recommended correction:**
Remove specific percentage or use general statement: "Most advertising works by creating dissatisfaction, then selling the solution"

## ⚠️ STATS THAT NEED BETTER SOURCING

### Need to find primary sources for:
- 70% teens with phone anxiety (Common Sense Media - need specific report)
- 59% say addicted to social media (Pew Research - need year/report)
- 48% feel relationships not meaningful (Harvard Study - need specific citation)
- 50% millennials left social media for mental health (Pew - verify)
- 89% phantom vibration syndrome (Computers in Human Behavior - need year)

## RECOMMENDATIONS FOR STATS PAGE

### High Priority Changes:
1. ✅ Change "210 phone checks" to "205 phone checks" (2024 data)
2. ❌ Remove or significantly modify "300 brand logos" claim - not supported by research
3. ❌ Fix loneliness stat: "61% in 2019, up from 54% in 2018"
4. ❌ Fix $1.2T description: it's industry revenue, not R&D spend
5. ❌ Remove or modify "52% higher depression from ads" - not directly supported
6. ❌ Remove "77% of ads" stat unless source can be verified

### General Principle:
For a validation landing page, it's better to:
- Use conservative, well-documented statistics
- Admit when we're making reasonable inferences ("Research suggests..." vs "77% of...")
- Link to sources where possible
- Remove any stat we can't verify from reputable sources
